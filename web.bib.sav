  abstract = {Fast and precise medical diagnosis of human cancer is crucial for treatment decisions. Gene selection consists of identifying a set of informative genes from microarray data to allow high predictive accuracy in human cancer classification. This task is a combinatorial search problem, and optimisation methods can be applied for its resolution. In this paper, two memetic micro-genetic algorithms (MuV1 and MuV2) with different hybridisation approaches are proposed for feature selection of cancer microarray data. Seven gene expression datasets are used for experimentation. The comparison with stochastic state-of-the-art optimisation techniques concludes that problem-dependent local search methods combined with micro-genetic algorithms improve feature selection of cancer microarray data.},

  abstract  = {Vaccination has become the most powerful tool to win the battle at COVID-19. Optimised distribution of the vaccines is crucial to provide a level of immunisation over a country that protects susceptible individuals from infectious diseases. However, the COVID-19 vaccines are recent, so manufacturing is slow. Consequently, its limited supply has a tremendous impact on the distribution policies in countries that depend on foreign supplies. In this chapter, a model of distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is proposed, and several optimisation algorithms are tested. The proposal is tested in the Argentine scenario. It features an Â essential demonstration of the impact of an optimised distribution of the vaccine.},

  abstract = {In recent years, technology in medicine has shown a significant advance due to artificial intelligence becoming a framework to make accurate medical diagnoses. Models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) can detect implicit patterns in data, allowing identifying patients conditions that cannot be seen easily. MLPs consist of biased neurons arranged in layers, connected by weighted connections. Their effectiveness depends on finding the optimal weights and biases that reduce the classification error, which is usually done by using the Back Propagation algorithm (BP). But BP has several disadvantages that could provoke the MLP not to learn. Metaheuristics are alternatives to BP that reach high-quality solutions without using many computational resources. In this work, the Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA) with a specially designed crossover operator called Damped Crossover (DX), is proposed to optimise weights and biases of the MLP to classify medical data. When compared against state-of-the-art algorithms, the CGA configured with DX obtained the minimal Mean Square Error value in three out of the five considered medical datasets and was the quickest algorithm with four datasets, showing a better balance between time consumed and optimisation performance. Additionally, it is competitive in enhancing classification quality, reaching the best accuracy with two datasets and the second-best accuracy with two of the remaining.},

This paper proposes a Memetic Cellular Genetic Algorithm (MCGA) to solve the Feature Selection problem of cancer microarray datasets.

  abstract = {Optimization via Simulation (OvS) is a useful optimization tool to find a solution to an optimization problem that is difficult to model analytically. OvS consists in evaluating potential solutions through simulation executions; however, its high computational cost is a factor that can make its implementation infeasible. This issue also occurs in multi-objective problems, which tend to be expensive to solve. In this work, we present a new hybrid multi-objective OvS algorithm, which uses Kriging-type metamodels to estimate the simulations results and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to manage the optimization process. Our proposal succeeds in reducing the computational cost significantly without affecting the quality of the results obtained. The evolutionary part of the hybrid algorithm is based on the popular NSGA-II. The hybrid method is compared to the canonical NSGA-II and other hybrid approaches, showing a good performance not only in the quality of the solutions but also as computational cost saving.},

  abstract = {This article presents a parallel evolutionary algorithm for public transport optimization by synchronizing traffic lights in the context of Bus Rapid Transit systems. The related optimization problem is NP-hard, so exact computational methods are not useful to solve real-world instances. Our research introduces a parallel evolutionary algorithm to efficiently configure and synchronize traffic lights and improve the average speed of buses and other vehicles. The Bus Rapid Transit on GarzÃ³n Avenue (Montevideo, Uruguay) is used as a case study. This is an interesting complex urban scenario due to the number of crossings, streets, and traffic lights in the zone. The experimental analysis compares the numerical results computed by the parallel evolutionary algorithm with a scenario that models the current reality. The results show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm achieves better quality of service when compared with the current reality, improving up to 15.3% the average bus speed and 24.8% the average speed of other vehicles. A multiobjective optimization analysis also demonstrates that additional improvements can be achieved by assigning different priorities to buses and other vehicles. In addition, further improvements can be achieved on a modified scenario simply by deleting a few bus stops and changing some traffic lights rules. The benefits of using a parallel solver are also highlighted, as the parallel version is able to accelerate the execution times up to 26.9Ã when compared with the sequential version.},
